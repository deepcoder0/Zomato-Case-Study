The menu is so massive you can‚Äôt choose what to eat and what not to!  The last time I went there I ordered: ‚Ä¢ DEHYDRATED SPINACH SUSHI: Ik from the name you must be thinking why should I eat spinach that was my reaction as well but the chef recommended us to try that..and trust me it is worth the hype !  ‚Ä¢ Mushroom Bao: If you‚Äôre a mushroom lover these bao are for you...extremely flavourful and quite big in size! ‚Ä¢ PAD THAI NOODLES: We had to order their infamous pad thai noodles..so tasty with a very different flavour that immediately soothes your taste buds. Also try their Udon Noodles. ‚Ä¢ CHOCOLATE BALL ON FIRE: The picture says it all..chocolate lovers this is your go to dish !

      "Milind 4 If u are bored of Barbeque nation , this place is must try for uü§ìüî•üòÖ. It is one of the best barbeque restaurants in Delhi offering rooftop seating . So we opted for rooftop seating for our lunch & the view was amazing üî•üòª. We opted for veg buffet which included a range of starters like crispy corn , paneer tikka , spicy mushroom . Then in main course we tried manchurian with noodles . As a complementary drink I ordered Kiwi mojito which was so refreshing & eye catchy tooüòªüî•üî•üî•ü§ìü§ì. So if u visit Pitampura next time don't miss this amazing place.üëªüî•ü§ìüòªüòª\n"
